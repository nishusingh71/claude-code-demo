# Vercel Deployment with Cloudinary Setup

## Current Issue: Cloudinary Assets Not Showing on Vercel

Your Cloudinary configuration is correct locally, and assets are uploaded successfully. The issue is likely missing environment variables in Vercel production.

## ‚úÖ Verified Working Locally
- ‚úÖ Cloudinary configuration (cloud: dhwi5wevf)
- ‚úÖ Assets uploaded to Cloudinary:
  - `dsecure/logos/logo` (main logo)
  - `dsecure/logos/logo-white` (white logo)
- ‚úÖ Test URLs working:
  - https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwi5wevf/image/upload/dsecure/logos/logo
  - https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwi5wevf/image/upload/dsecure/logos/logo-white

## üîß Fix: Set Vercel Environment Variables

### Step 1: Access Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Navigate to your project dashboard
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable
Add the following environment variable:

```
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dhwi5wevf
```

**Important:** Make sure to:
- Set for **Production** environment
- Use exact variable name: `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- Use exact value: `dhwi5wevf`

### Step 3: Redeploy
After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on your latest deployment
3. Or trigger a new deployment by pushing to your repository

## üß™ Test Deployment

### Option 1: Visit Diagnostics Page
Once deployed, visit: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/diagnostics`

This page will show:
- Environment variable status
- Live image loading tests
- Troubleshooting information

### Option 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open your deployed site
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check Console for any Cloudinary errors
4. Check Network tab for failed image requests

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Environment Variable Not Working
**Solution:** 
- Verify exact spelling: `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- Ensure it's set for Production environment
- Redeploy after setting the variable

### Issue: Images Still Not Loading
**Solution:**
- Check browser network tab for 404 errors
- Verify URLs in browser:
  - https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwi5wevf/image/upload/dsecure/logos/logo
  - https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwi5wevf/image/upload/dsecure/logos/logo-white

### Issue: CORS Errors
**Solution:**
- In Cloudinary dashboard, check domain whitelist
- Add your Vercel domain to allowed origins

## üìù Environment Variable Template

For reference, your `.env.local` should contain:
```
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dhwi5wevf
```

And your Vercel environment variables should have:
```
Key: VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
Value: dhwi5wevf
Environment: Production
```

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

```bash
# Test locally first
npm run dev

# Test Cloudinary setup
npm run test-cloudinary

# Verify assets are uploaded
npm run verify-assets

# Build and deploy
npm run build
# Then deploy to Vercel
```

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Set the environment variable in Vercel** (most likely fix)
2. **Redeploy your application**
3. **Visit `/diagnostics` page** to verify the fix
4. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors

The diagnostics page will clearly show whether the environment variable is set correctly and whether images are loading.
